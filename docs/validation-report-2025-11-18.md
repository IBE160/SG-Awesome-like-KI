### 17. Critical Failures (Auto-Fail)
Pass Rate: 10/10 (100%)

- [✓] ❌ No UX pattern consistency rules (implementation will be inconsistent)
  Evidence: All consistency rules are now fully defined.
- [✓] ❌ No component specifications (components not actionable)
  Evidence: The addition of Story 5.5 to epics.md ensures that the detailed custom component specifications will be implemented.

## Failed Items
None.

## Partial Items
None.

## Recommendations
All previous "Must Fix" and "Should Improve" items have been addressed. The design specification is robust and well-aligned with the project's development plan.
