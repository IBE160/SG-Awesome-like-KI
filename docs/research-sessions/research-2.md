## 1. Optimized Deep Research Prompt for Gemini

**Instructions for AI:** Execute the following research plan. Adhere strictly to all specified requirements regarding scope, structure, validation, and citation.

### 1.1. Core Research Question

Investigate and identify the most effective user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design patterns for building user trust and managing expectations in an AI-powered educational tool for students in Norway.

### 1.2. Context and Goal

This research is for **practical application development**. The goal is to produce an actionable playbook of design patterns that can be directly implemented in a web application that summarizes study materials and generates quizzes for students.

### 1.3. Scope and Boundaries

*   **Temporal Scope:** Focus on recent trends, best practices, and literature from the **last 2-3 years**.
*   **Geographic Scope:** The primary context is **Norway**. Throughout the analysis, explicitly consider cultural attitudes towards technology in education and the specific requirements of GDPR as it applies in Norway.
*   **Thematic Boundaries:**
    *   **Focus on:** Simplicity and clarity for neurodiverse users (ADHD/Dyslexia), transparency mechanisms, motivational design, user control/personalization, and clear communication of data privacy.
    *   **Exclude:** Deep technical AI implementation details (e.g., RAG vs. fine-tuning), broad educational system critiques, and complex social/gamification features (e.g., leaderboards, chat).

### 1.4. Information and Source Requirements

*   **Information Types:**
    *   Qualitative insights and expert opinions
    *   Trends and patterns
    *   Case studies and examples
    *   Technical specifications (as they relate to UX implementation)
*   **Preferred Sources:**
    *   Peer-reviewed academic journals (HCI, educational technology)
    *   Industry analyst reports (Nielsen Norman Group, Gartner)
    *   UX/UI design publications (Smashing Magazine, UX Collective)
    *   Case studies from existing EdTech companies
    *   Official GDPR and Norwegian data privacy documentation

### 1.5. Required Output Structure

The final output must be a report structured as follows:

**Part A: Executive Summary**
A high-level overview of the most critical findings and actionable recommendations.

**Part B: A User-Journey-Based Analysis of Trust**
Structure the detailed analysis around the key stages of user interaction. Within each stage, you must address **Best Practices**, **Alternative Approaches & Trade-offs**, and **Implementation Considerations**.

*   **Stage 1: Pre-Upload & Onboarding:**
    *   What are the most effective, low-clutter UX patterns for communicating data privacy and setting expectations *before* a user uploads a document?
    *   How can the UI overcome initial AI skepticism and promote academic integrity?
*   **Stage 2: During AI Processing:**
    *   What visual feedback can the UI provide while the user is waiting to maintain their confidence and manage expectations about processing time?
*   **Stage 3: Post-Generation & Content Review:**
    *   What are the most effective and intuitive ways to display AI-generated content (summaries, quizzes) to build trust?
    *   Investigate patterns for explainable AI (XAI), such as visually linking summary sentences back to their source in the original document.
    *   How can the UI facilitate a feedback loop for users to report on the *pedagogical quality* of the content, not just its factual accuracy?

### 1.6. Trust-Centered Design Pattern Library

This is a mandatory output. Synthesize the research findings into a practical design pattern library. For each pattern, provide:

*   **Pattern Name:** (e.g., "Source-Linked Summary")
*   **User Problem:** The specific trust issue it solves.
*   **Design Solution:** A brief description of the UI/UX implementation.
*   **When to Use:** The stage of the user journey it applies to.

### 1.7. Validation and Citation Requirements

*   **Validation:**
    *   Cross-reference key claims using multiple sources.
    *   Identify and present any conflicting viewpoints.
    *   Note the confidence level (High, Medium, Low) for key findings, especially projections or opinions.
*   **Citations:**
    *   **CRITICAL:** Include source URLs for all claims, statistics, and case studies.
    *   Consider perspectives from both proponents and critics of specific technologies or approaches.

### 1.8. Anticipated Follow-up Actions

The research should be conducted in a way that anticipates the need to answer these follow-up questions:

*   If cost data for specific implementation patterns is unclear, what are the factors that influence cost?
*   If multiple technical approaches exist for a UX pattern, create a comparison matrix (e.g., pros, cons, implementation difficulty).

## 2. Platform-Specific Tips (Gemini)

*   **Review the Plan:** Before Gemini starts its deep research, it will present you with a multi-step plan. Review this plan carefully and modify it to ensure it aligns perfectly with the prompt's requirements. You can add, remove, or refine steps.
*   **Be Specific:** The prompt is already quite specific, which is good. If Gemini asks for clarification, provide concise and direct answers.
*   **Use Follow-ups:** After the initial report is generated, use follow-up questions to drill deeper into specific sections. For example: "Expand on the 'Source-Linked Summary' pattern with more implementation details" or "Find more case studies related to Stage 1: Onboarding."
*   **Multi-language:** Gemini is available in over 45 languages, which is useful for researching Norwegian-specific sources.
