# Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** 2025-10-29
**Facilitator:** Business Analyst Mary
**Participant:** BIP

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** What are the most critical user problems our AI Study Buddy should solve, specifically concerning information overload?

**Session Goals:** To explore the root causes and user-specific nuances of information overload for students using the AI Study Buddy.

**Techniques Used:** 
- Five Whys
- Role Playing
- What If Scenarios

**Total Ideas Generated:** 15+

### Key Themes Identified:

- The tension between the need for comprehensive knowledge (for employability) and the student's capacity to process it.
- The critical role of motivation and engagement, which is severely impacted by traditional, text-heavy materials.
- The diverse emotional and practical impacts of information overload across different user personas (burnout, loss of self-faith, time scarcity).
- The challenge for AI is not just to reduce information, but to curate it wisely without losing essential context or introducing errors.

## Technique Sessions

### Five Whys Session

- **Problem:** Students feel overwhelmed by information overload.
- **Why 1:** They receive a lot of information in a short time.
- **Why 2:** Because the syllabus is very large in most cases.
- **Why 3:** Because there is a lot to learn and the topics are quite broad.
- **Why 4:** To learn as much as possible and be employable in the future.
- **Root Cause Insight:** Information overload is a direct consequence of the educational goal to make students highly employable, meaning solutions must respect the need for comprehensive knowledge while mitigating the overload.

### Role Playing Session

**Persona: Busy parent with a full-time job**
- **Problem:** Not enough time to process information, making it difficult to retain important details.
- **Impact:** Studying becomes boring, especially with text-based material, leading to reduced motivation and poor performance.

**Persona: Student with dyslexia and/or ADHD**
- **Problem:** Feel helpless and overwhelmed, struggling to discern what information is critical. Heavy, difficult text exacerbates this.
- **Impact:** Leads to loss of concentration, frustration, demotivation, and a loss of faith in their own abilities. They may give up and quit early.

**Persona: Student aiming for good grades**
- **Problem:** Difficulty discerning what is most important, leading them to study the entire syllabus in exhaustive detail.
- **Impact:** This is tiresome and can lead to burnout, causing performance to drop before an exam.

### What If Scenarios Session

**Scenario 1: What if students could ONLY use the AI Study Buddy?**
- **Problems Solved:** Information overload, boring study techniques, inability to focus on important topics.
- **New Problems Created:** Risk of focusing on the wrong things, potential for AI misinformation, AI might still provide too much information.

**Scenario 2: What if the AI was forced to be "minimalist"?**
- **Opportunities:** The student may feel more in control and be more capable of remembering all the information.
- **Challenges:** The information might be too little, and important context or the "bigger picture" may be lost.
