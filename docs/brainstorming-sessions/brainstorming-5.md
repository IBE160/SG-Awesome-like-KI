## Technique Sessions

### Reverse Brainstorming Session: Identifying and Flipping Bad User Experiences

We started by brainstorming all the ways a user could have a *bad* experience with the application. Then, for each negative point, we flipped it into a positive design goal or solution.

#### Identified Bad User Experiences:

*   Too much information on the front page.
*   Too many distractions during the quiz/summary.
*   Difficulties logging in.
*   Too slow.
*   The app doesn't work (crashes, freezes).
*   The summary doesn't capture the most important information.
*   Not getting any progress (lack of feedback, feeling stuck).
*   Unclear instructions or onboarding.
*   Poor quiz quality (confusing, irrelevant, or incorrect questions/answers).
*   Losing their work or history.
*   Privacy concerns regarding uploaded documents.

#### Flipped into Positive Design Goals:

1.  **Clean & Focused Home Screen:** Upon login, the user is presented with a simple interface focused on a primary action, like "Upload Document" or "Search for Information."
2.  **Focused Quiz Interface:** The quiz screen should only display the question, answer options/box, and a small, positive motivational quote. No other distracting elements.
3.  **Clear & Sourced Summary Display:** The summary screen will feature a prominent title, the summary content itself, and a list of sources at the bottom to indicate the documents used for generation.
4.  **Simple & Secure Login:** The initial login process will be straightforward but secure. After the first login, users will have the option to enable a "quick login" method, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, for faster access.
5.  **Responsive Core Actions:** Key actions, specifically document uploading and summary/quiz generation, must be fast. During these processes, the app will display clear progress indicators (like a loading bar or animation) to manage user expectations and prevent them from feeling like the app is stuck.
6.  **Robust & Reliable Performance:** The application will be stable, free from crashes and freezes, and consistently responsive, ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted user experience.
7.  **Goal-Oriented Summarization:** The application will allow users to optionally provide learning goals or key topics alongside their document. The summarization algorithm will prioritize these goals to ensure the output is highly relevant and captures the most important information for the user's specific needs. This "Upload Learning Goals" option could be a feature on the home screen.
8.  **Encouraging Progress & Feedback:** The app will integrate motivational quotes, particularly within the quiz feedback mechanism, to encourage users. Quiz results will provide clear, constructive feedback on performance, highlighting *both correctly and incorrectly answered questions* to foster a continuous sense of progress and reinforce existing knowledge.
9.  **Clear Onboarding & In-App Guidance:** The initial user experience, starting from the home page and extending through core actions like "Upload Document" and "Create Quiz," will feature simple, intuitive instructions and guidance to ensure users understand how to effectively use the application without confusion.
10. **Adaptive & Relevant Quizzes:** The application will generate quizzes that are relevant to the core information in the document. Users will have the option to choose a quiz length (e.g., "short" or "long"). Short quizzes will focus on the most critical facts, while longer quizzes will cover a broader range of details, allowing users to tailor the assessment to their study needs.
11. **Automatic Saving & Accessible History:** The application will automatically save all generated summaries, quiz results, and uploaded documents. The home screen will feature clear buttons like "History" and "Uploaded Documents," allowing users to easily access and review their past activities and content, ensuring their work is always preserved and accessible.
12. **User-Controlled Privacy & GDPR Compliance:** The application will be GDPR compliant. Users will have explicit control over their uploaded documents, with an option to keep them private or share them with the community. All documents will be deletable by the user at any time.
