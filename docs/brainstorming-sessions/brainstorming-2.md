## Technique Sessions

### Five Whys Session

- **Problem:** Students with ADHD and dyslexia find it hard to read and might want to have different ways of learning.
- **Why 1:** Because people with ADHD often don't have the ability to focus, and when it comes to dyslexia the whole disability is about struggling to read.
- **Why 2:** Because when they try to just read the texts, they either start thinking about completely different things, or they might just leave to do something else. Or for people with dyslexia, they might get a headache. This can also lead to losing motivation.
- **Why 3:** This might lead to giving up on school, or just generally giving up on life.
- **Why 4:** They might feel like they are no good for anything or that they never will be able to learn anything.
- **Root Cause Insight:** The current educational system's reliance on reading long texts and passive listening is not conducive to the learning styles and needs of students with ADHD and dyslexia, leading to feelings of inadequacy and potential disengagement from education.

### Question Storming Session

- How are everyone supposed to learn the same way? We are not all the same!
- Why are we supposed to learn the same way?
- Why not help students that need a different way of learning?
- Why do we make students with ADHD or dyslexia feel dumber, just because they can't sit still and read a whole page with text?
- How much training do educators actually receive about ADHD, dyslexia, and neurodiversity?
- Why is the current education system still built around text-heavy and lecture-based learning when many students learn better through other formats (audio, visual, interactive)?
- How do repeated negative experiences (poor grades, feedback on spelling/writing) affect their self-esteem and persistence in education?
- How does dyslexia change how a student processes written text, and what alternative formats help them most?
- How are students with learning differences being supported before they fail or burn out?
- How effectively are accommodations (like extra time or text-to-speech) being used — are they enough, or just compensations for a deeper systemic issue?
- Are schools and universities evaluating what students know or how well they can express it in writing?
- How does ADHD affect focus, memory, and reading comprehension during typical study tasks?
- What would a truly inclusive education system look like — one that assumes diverse learning needs as the default, not the exception?

### Mind Map Session

**Central Topic:** The current educational system's reliance on reading long texts and passive listening is not conducive to the learning styles and needs of students with ADHD and dyslexia, leading to feelings of inadequacy and potential disengagement from education.

**Main Branch 1: How it feels to navigate an unsupportive system — the human and emotional side.**
- Why do we make students with ADHD or dyslexia feel dumber, just because they can't sit still and read a whole page with text?
- How do repeated negative experiences (poor grades, feedback on spelling/writing) affect their self-esteem and persistence in education?

**Main Branch 2: How the structure, policies, and traditions of education fail to support diverse learners.**
- Why not help students that need a different way of learning?
- How much training do educators actually receive about ADHD, dyslexia, and neurodiversity?
- Why is the current education system still built around text-heavy and lecture-based learning when many students learn better through other formats (audio, visual, interactive)?
- How are students with learning differences being supported before they fail or burn out?
- How effectively are accommodations (like extra time or text-to-speech) being used — are they enough, or just compensations for a deeper systemic issue?

**Main Branch 3: How ADHD and dyslexia affect the way students process, retain, and organize information.**
- How are everyone supposed to learn the same way? We are not all the same!
- Why are we supposed to learn the same way?
- How does dyslexia change how a student processes written text, and what alternative formats help them most?
- Are schools and universities evaluating what students know or how well they can express it in writing?
- How does ADHD affect focus, memory, and reading comprehension during typical study tasks?

**Main Branch 4: Fairness, access, and the broader question of who gets to succeed in the current system.**
- What would a truly inclusive education system look like — one that assumes diverse learning needs as the default, not the exception?

## Idea Categorization

### Immediate Opportunities

_Ideas ready to implement now_

- Addressing the human and emotional side by providing alternative learning methods.

### Future Innovations

_Ideas requiring development/research_

- A mix of actionable items within how ADHD and dyslexia affect information processing, which can be addressed by the app we're discussing.

### Moonshots

_Ambitious, transformative concepts_

- The broader question of creating a truly inclusive education system.

### Insights and Learnings

_Key realizations from the session_

**Core Problem:** The current educational system's over-reliance on traditional text-based learning creates significant barriers for neurodiverse students, leading to a cycle of frustration, demotivation, and a diminished sense of self-worth.

**Core Solution (within project scope):** To create an application that empowers these students by transforming dense texts into concise summaries and interactive quizzes, thereby providing an alternative, more engaging, and effective pathway to learning and mastery.

**Key Lessons:**
1. The solution must address both the "how" of learning and the "how" of assessment.
2. The app should provide a few distinct learning methods and gather data for future personalization.
3. The solution should be framed as empowerment, not just accommodation.
4. Be mindful of the potential downsides of a technology-based solution (digital crutch, digital divide).
5. The app can be a "proof of concept" for a more inclusive and personalized approach.

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

#### #1 Priority: Providing alternative learning methods (summaries, quizzes)

- Rationale: It addresses the emotional toll and helps create a more inclusive learning environment.
- Next steps: More brainstorming and research sessions.
- Resources needed: Same as this session.
- Timeline: 4-5 days for the sessions.

#### #2 Priority: Addressing the emotional toll on students.

- Rationale: To help students who struggle with mental health because of learning disabilities.
- Next steps: When taking a quiz, students get a summary of right/wrong answers and a positive, motivational sentence.
- Resources needed: Same as this session, plus a pre-vetted list of motivational quotes.
- Timeline: To be completed within the 4-week project timeline.

#### #3 Priority: Creating a more inclusive learning environment (our "moonshot").

- Rationale: To help every student that needs it.
- Next steps: Not to focus on this immediately, as it's long-term. The act of making the app itself contributes to this goal.
- Resources needed: Not applicable for immediate planning.
- Timeline: Not applicable for immediate planning.
