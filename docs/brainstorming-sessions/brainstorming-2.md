## Technique Sessions

### Five Whys Session

- **Problem:** Students with ADHD and dyslexia find it hard to read and might want to have different ways of learning.
- **Why 1:** Because people with ADHD often don't have the ability to focus, and when it comes to dyslexia the whole disability is about struggling to read.
- **Why 2:** Because when they try to just read the texts, they either start thinking about completely different things, or they might just leave to do something else. Or for people with dyslexia, they might get a headache. This can also lead to losing motivation.
- **Why 3:** This might lead to giving up on school, or just generally giving up on life.
- **Why 4:** They might feel like they are no good for anything or that they never will be able to learn anything.
- **Root Cause Insight:** The current educational system's reliance on reading long texts and passive listening is not conducive to the learning styles and needs of students with ADHD and dyslexia, leading to feelings of inadequacy and potential disengagement from education.

### Question Storming Session

- How are everyone supposed to learn the same way? We are not all the same!
- Why are we supposed to learn the same way?
- Why not help students that need a different way of learning?
- Why do we make students with ADHD or dyslexia feel dumber, just because they can't sit still and read a whole page with text?
- How much training do educators actually receive about ADHD, dyslexia, and neurodiversity?
- Why is the current education system still built around text-heavy and lecture-based learning when many students learn better through other formats (audio, visual, interactive)?
- How do repeated negative experiences (poor grades, feedback on spelling/writing) affect their self-esteem and persistence in education?
- How does dyslexia change how a student processes written text, and what alternative formats help them most?
- How are students with learning differences being supported before they fail or burn out?
- How effectively are accommodations (like extra time or text-to-speech) being used — are they enough, or just compensations for a deeper systemic issue?
- Are schools and universities evaluating what students know or how well they can express it in writing?
- How does ADHD affect focus, memory, and reading comprehension during typical study tasks?
- What would a truly inclusive education system look like — one that assumes diverse learning needs as the default, not the exception?

### Mind Map Session

**Central Topic:** The current educational system's reliance on reading long texts and passive listening is not conducive to the learning styles and needs of students with ADHD and dyslexia, leading to feelings of inadequacy and potential disengagement from education.

**Main Branch 1: How it feels to navigate an unsupportive system — the human and emotional side.**
- Why do we make students with ADHD or dyslexia feel dumber, just because they can't sit still and read a whole page with text?
- How do repeated negative experiences (poor grades, feedback on spelling/writing) affect their self-esteem and persistence in education?

**Main Branch 2: How the structure, policies, and traditions of education fail to support diverse learners.**
- Why not help students that need a different way of learning?
- How much training do educators actually receive about ADHD, dyslexia, and neurodiversity?
- Why is the current education system still built around text-heavy and lecture-based learning when many students learn better through other formats (audio, visual, interactive)?
- How are students with learning differences being supported before they fail or burn out?
- How effectively are accommodations (like extra time or text-to-speech) being used — are they enough, or just compensations for a deeper systemic issue?

**Main Branch 3: How ADHD and dyslexia affect the way students process, retain, and organize information.**
- How are everyone supposed to learn the same way? We are not all the same!
- Why are we supposed to learn the same way?
- How does dyslexia change how a student processes written text, and what alternative formats help them most?
- Are schools and universities evaluating what students know or how well they can express it in writing?
- How does ADHD affect focus, memory, and reading comprehension during typical study tasks?

**Main Branch 4: Fairness, access, and the broader question of who gets to succeed in the current system.**
- What would a truly inclusive education system look like — one that assumes diverse learning needs as the default, not the exception?

## Idea Categorization

### Moonshots

_Ambitious, transformative concepts_

- The broader question of creating a truly inclusive education system.

### Insights and Learnings

_Key realizations from the session_

**Core Problem:** The current educational system's over-reliance on traditional text-based learning creates significant barriers for neurodiverse students, leading to a cycle of frustration, demotivation, and a diminished sense of self-worth.

**Core Solution (within project scope):** To create an application that empowers these students by transforming dense texts into concise summaries and interactive quizzes, thereby providing an alternative, more engaging, and effective pathway to learning and mastery.

**Key Lessons:**
1. The solution must address both the "how" of learning and the "how" of assessment.
2. The app should provide a few distinct learning methods and and gather data for future personalization.
3. The solution should be framed as empowerment, not just accommodation.
4. Be mindful of the potential downsides of a technology-based solution (digital crutch, digital divide).
5. The app can be a "proof of concept" for a more inclusive and personalized approach.

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

#### #1 Priority: Providing alternative learning methods (summaries, quizzes)

- Rationale: It addresses the emotional toll and helps create a more inclusive learning environment.
- Next steps: More brainstorming and research sessions.
- Resources needed: Same as this session.
- Timeline: 4-5 days for the sessions.

#### #2 Priority: Addressing the emotional toll on students.

- Rationale: To help students who struggle with mental health because of learning disabilities.
- Next steps: When taking a quiz, students get a summary of right/wrong answers and a positive, motivational sentence.
- Resources needed: Same as this session, plus a pre-vetted list of motivational quotes.
- Timeline: To be completed within the 4-week project timeline.

#### #3 Priority: Creating a more inclusive learning environment (our "moonshot").

- Rationale: To help every student that needs it.
- Next steps: Not to focus on this immediately, as it's long-term. The act of making the app itself contributes to this goal.
- Resources needed: Not applicable for immediate planning.
- Timeline: Not applicable for immediate planning.

## Brainstorming Session 2 - Part 2 (2025-11-05)

**Focus:** Shifting from students with ADHD/dyslexia to two new user groups:
1.  Busy parents with full-time jobs
2.  Students aiming for good grades

**Techniques Used:** Role Playing, Five Whys, "What If" Scenarios

### Technique 1: Role Playing

#### Persona 1: Busy Parent with a Full-Time Job

*   **Daily Routine:** Wakes up, rushes through morning, maybe has a moment for a quick quiz. Commutes to work (ideal time for audio summaries). Tries to squeeze in a short summary during breaks. Commute home, errands, kids. Cooks dinner. Finally, a small window to study late at night.
*   **Core Pain Point:** Extreme time scarcity. The overwhelming feeling is one of pressure to be efficient and a fear of wasting precious minutes on non-essential information.
*   **Key Idea Generated:** The ability to upload learning goals to ensure the app focuses on the most critical material. Audio summaries for commutes are essential.

#### Persona 2: Student Aiming for Good Grades

*   **Core Pain Point:** The overwhelming feeling of having to learn EVERYTHING to get from a B to an A. The pressure is immense.

### Technique 2: Five Whys (on the "Ambitious Student" persona)

*   **Problem:** I feel like I have to learn EVERYTHING.
*   **Why 1?** To be able to answer every question right and get top grades.
*   **Why 2?** I feel pressure from parents and friends to get good grades.
*   **Why 3?** My parents had good grades and got good jobs, and they want the same for me. It's a proven path to success.
*   **Why 4?** Following this path makes me feel important.
*   **Root Cause Insight:** The drive for top grades is not just about knowledge; it's about a deep-seated need to **feel seen and needed**.

### Technique 3: "What If" Scenarios (addressing the root cause)

*   **Question:** What if our app could make you feel "seen and needed" *before* you even get the top grade?
*   **Idea 1:** Give positive motivational quotes.
*   **Refinement:** Tie the quotes directly to the answers in a quiz, making the encouragement feel earned and relevant.
*   **Question:** What if the app could show you how the knowledge you're gaining could be used to help others or solve real-world problems?
*   **Insight:** This would connect learning to a sense of purpose, directly addressing the need to feel "needed".

## SMART Goals Defined (Session with Business Analyst Mary)

### 1. SMART Goal for Priority #1 (Providing alternative learning methods - summaries, quizzes):
> **Within 4 weeks, we will develop and launch a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that allows a user to upload a plain text document and receive a simple, auto-generated summary and a multiple-choice quiz. Success will be measured by conducting a user-testing session with at least 5 students, where they successfully generate a total of at least 10 summaries and 10 quizzes, thereby validating the core functionality of the app.**

### 2. SMART Goal for Priority #2 (Addressing the emotional toll on students):
> **Within 4 weeks, we will implement a quiz results screen that, after every quiz, displays the user's score, a list of incorrectly answered questions, and a motivational quote from a predefined list of at least 20 quotes. This feature is relevant as it aims to motivate students to focus on areas where they show low results, thereby contributing to a more positive learning experience and addressing potential emotional discouragement.**

### 3. SMART Goal for Priority #3 (Creating a more inclusive learning environment):
> **Within 4 weeks, we will design and implement the quiz and summary interface to be clean, uncluttered, and readable, adhering to a predefined checklist of at least 5 basic accessibility best practices. Success will be measured by gathering qualitative feedback on clarity and ease of use from at least 5 users during a testing session. This is relevant because prioritizing accessibility and clarity creates a fundamentally equitable experience, giving all students an equal opportunity to engage with the material and demonstrate their knowledge, which is the first step towards our long-term vision of a truly inclusive learning environment.**
